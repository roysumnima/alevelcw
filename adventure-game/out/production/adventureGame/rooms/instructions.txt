 HOW TO EDIT ROOMS
-------------------
There are a maximum of 36 room files named:
0.csv, 1.csv, ... , 9.csv, A.csv, B.csv, ..., Z.csv.

Use any of the following symbols to represent objects in the room file.
Each symbol corresponds to the image files in the images folder.


* : The main characterâ€™s starting point
This should only appear in one of the rooms)


0-9, A-Z : door to the room with the respective name
The door represent by 0 will lead to room 0 etc.


a-z : Item
Items can be collected/discarded and stored in the main character's inventory.


% : Guard
This is a completely stationary enemy.

& : Lookout
This is an enemy that moves towards the main character at all times

&[ ] : Patrol
Patrol is represented by an '&' followed by any other character, eg '&.'
This is an enemy that moves between point A and point B.
To represent these two points, put two of the patrol symbols in the file.
(Eg. Put two '&.' Symbols in different places in the file.


** : Ending door
This functions as a door. When the main character enters this door, they win the game.


/ : Blocked off area
This shows up like, and acts like, a wall.
